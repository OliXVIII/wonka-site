      - You will use relevant data to populate the dataset.
      - Try to compare 2 elements together in the dataset.
      - Use these 2 elements to create a comparison and contrast between 2 ideas.
      - Use these 2 elements to illustrate a point or a concept.
      - The chart must be easy to understand and visually appealing, therefore the dataset should be simple and meaningful.
      - If the data is a percentage, make sure this is clear that it is a percentage.
      - All data should reflect realistic but yet point proving values.
      - You need to create a dataset for a chart ${type ? `of type ${type}` : 'with a type of bar or pie'}.
      - For bar chart, we need at least 2-3 datasets with multiple data to compare for each clear label.
      - For pie chart, we want one dataset with multiple data to compare and analyze with clear labels.
      - The source of the data should be the most credible source you can find to support the data, formated in APA style.
      - Labels should be clear and explanatory, while still being concise.
